He's an exciting horse, but he's still got a bit to learn and is a bit raw. He'd shown enough at home, plenty to be honest, but he's so laid-back, which was a little concern of mine and that's maybe why he was a longer price than he should have been. I think he's more 6f than 5f and he may get further next year; his stride is quite eyecatching and he seems to do everything effortlessly as you could see with Danny, who didn't have to give him any urgings.

He was one of those where we probably bought him at the right time as his rating was down into the 60s. He was running well without doing an awful lot, but when he got down to a mark of 50 he started winning. We put a visor on and it helped a bit, but it wasn't until he got the blinkers on that things started to happen. Even the first day he won at Nottingham, I still maintain that if he hadn't got a bump near the finish, he'd have finished second; he got a bump and seemed to take off and won really well. He then went to Beverley and had a bit of a troubled passage but got to the front and was well on top at the finish. When he went to Wetherby for his third success, the ground was plenty quick enough for him and the race didn't go as smoothly as we'd have liked, but he still won, whiwas fair play to him. He's got his confidence back and remembered how to win. If he wants to win again, he's still a long way ahead of the handicapper.
