This year, though, they've been tough races. We had him entered in the Stewards' Cup but the problem was that when the weights came out he was on a mark of 110. However, by the time of the race he had dropped to 107 and we felt there was no point running him off a mark 3lb higher than his actual rating, so that's why we missed the race.

He is a fine, big chasing type and the fact he won at Carlisle in his first attempt over hurdles was a bonus. He is not short of speed and the plan is to go to Sandown on Friday for the Grade 2 Winter Novices' Hurdle. If things go well there we will look for something bigger over Christmas.

I loved the manner in which Il Etait Temps did it. I was really taken with how he walked round the parade ring before the race - I haven't seen him as loose for a while, and I thought if he could run like he walked, he'd run a big race. And then when he jumped off at the start, I think for the first three-quarters of a circuit, I was very worried. He just seemed very behind himself, and I don't think he'll need his hood in future. But he warmed to his task, jumped well later in the race and he just kept galloping. Jukebox Jury is a right sire and we'll be using more of him. I think probably trip is more important than track to him. He did win over two miles, but this performance today over two and a half is fantastic. At this end of the season horses are tired and he took a bit of time to warm into it, but I'm happy that he's going to improve for further a trip as he gets older. He's a fine horse, probably only 16.1hh if that - the normal sort for today is a big 16.3hh chaser - and the important thing about him is that he turns up for everything. He's made of iron.

I couldn't see that many options for him in February that were going to be run on decent ground and, luckily, I managed to persuade Andrew Wates to let me take him up to Musselburgh for the Scottish Triumph Hurdle. He's a big, scopey horse who stayed very well on the Flat and I wasn't sure he'd have the tactical speed for it. I thought he'd be running on and collecting some nice prize-money but it was a pleasant surprise how much speed he showed to win - the sprint times from the race were very good and his finishing percentage was outstanding. He has a terrific attitude and showed that in spades at Musselburgh. I'd like to get him qualified for the novices' championship final at Sandown on the last day of the season, so I suppose I might go for a qualifier at Newbury in a few weeks' time and then look at something like the juvenile handicap at Ascot at the end of March before going on to Sandown. That would be my plan A, but if he improves in spades again and takes himself to a rating where we think we should be having a crack at something like Aintree, that would be fantastic. I think we'll play it as sensibly as we can for the time being. 12-02-25"}],"number":5,"draw":0,"headgear":"","headgear_first":"","lbs":161,"ofr":130,"rpr":126,"ts":94,"jockey":"Kevin Brogan","jockey_id":96895,"last_run":"28","form":"5121","silk_url":"https://www.rp-assets.com/svg/0/3/7/208730.svg","trainer_rtf":"","stats":{"course":{"runs":"0","wins":"0"},"distance":{"runs":"4","wins":"2"},"going":{"runs":"2","wins":"1"},"jockey":{"last_14_runs":"10","last_14_wins":"0","last_14_wins_pct":"0%","last_14_profit":"-10.00","ovr_runs":"13","ovr_wins":"0","ovr_wins_pct":"0%","ovr_profit":"-13.00"},"trainer":{"last_14_runs":"2","last_14_wins":"0","last_14_wins_pct":"0%","last_14_profit":"-2.00","ovr_runs":"5","ovr_wins":"0","ovr_wins_pct":"0%","ovr_profit":"-5.00"}}},{"age":5,"horse_id":5674152,"name":"Mythical Moon","dob":"2020-02-28","sex":"gelding","sex_code":"G","colour":"b","region":"GB","breeder":"Yorton Farm Stud","dam":"Fabrika","dam_region":"GB","sire":"Pethers Moon","sire_region":"IRE","grandsire":"Dylan Thomas","damsire":"Presenting","damsire_region":"GB","trainer":"Alan King","trainer_id":13928,"trainer_location":"Wroughton, Wilts","trainer_14_days":{"runs":18,"wins":2,"percent":11},"owner":"The Lee Family, A Stennett & J Wright","prev_trainers":null,"prev_owners":null,"comment":"Won on hurdles debut and consistent since; however, this looks a difficult task","spotlight":"Made a winning debut over hurdles and has proved very consistent in defeat since, creditable third in Newbury handicap (2m) most recently; faces a stiffer task off same mark in this bigger prize.","quotes":null,"stable_tour":[{"horse":"Mythical Moon","horse_id":5674152,"quote":"He's a lovely, big horse and I thought he was a smart member of our bumper team last season.

He ran well to be beaten by a much higher-rated horse [Springwell Bay] on his chase debut. He did well over hurdles last season and it was a lovely first run and he can only improve for that. We have a plan to potentially go for the Rising Stars Novices' Chase at Wincanton next month. He needs nice ground and probably won't want to be running in the depths of winter.
