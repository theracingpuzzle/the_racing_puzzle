I felt that she's speeded up, so I dropped her back to 5f on Sunday at Beverley and she ran a cracker to finish second, beaten only a neck by Mission Command.

I've pitched him into some big handicaps this season and he's run creditably. There's a nice handicap in him and he deserves a big one. He's won on every ground but is probably best on good to firm.

We're in the Racing League this year, and so is Mia, so there could be something there. 26-07-24"}],"number":1,"draw":5,"headgear":"","headgear_first":"","lbs":135,"ofr":75,"rpr":89,"ts":76,"jockey":"Jack Nicholls(7)","jockey_id":102773,"last_run":"23","form":"7806-2","silk_url":"https://www.rp-assets.com/svg/8/8/7/16788.svg","trainer_rtf":"60","stats":{"course":{"runs":"5","wins":"0"},"distance":{"runs":"30","wins":"4"},"going":{"runs":"12","wins":"2"},"jockey":{"last_14_runs":"7","last_14_wins":"0","last_14_wins_pct":"0%","last_14_profit":"-7.00","ovr_runs":"2","ovr_wins":"0","ovr_wins_pct":"0%","ovr_profit":"-2.00"},"trainer":{"last_14_runs":"5","last_14_wins":"0","last_14_wins_pct":"0%","last_14_profit":"-5.00","ovr_runs":"57","ovr_wins":"5","ovr_wins_pct":"9%","ovr_profit":"-25.25"}}},{"age":8,"horse_id":2779137,"name":"Late Arrival","dob":"2017-04-20","sex":"gelding","sex_code":"G","colour":"b","region":"IRE","breeder":"Rabbah Bloodstock Limited","dam":"Powdermill","dam_region":"GB","sire":"Night Of Thunder","sire_region":"IRE","grandsire":"Dubawi","damsire":"Oasis Dream","damsire_region":"GB","trainer":"Michael & David Easterby","trainer_id":38543,"trainer_location":"Sheriff Hutton, N Yorks","trainer_14_days":{"runs":25,"wins":0,"percent":0},"owner":"S Windle & G Routledge","prev_trainers":[{"trainer":"Michael Easterby","trainer_id":699,"change_date":"2021-06-08"},{"trainer":"Simon & Ed Crisford","trainer_id":37478,"change_date":"2021-05-08"},{"trainer":"Simon Crisford","trainer_id":30020,"change_date":"2020-05-27"}],"prev_owners":[{"owner":"A Pollock, S Windle & G Routledge","owner_id":318005,"change_date":"2023-04-24"},{"owner":"A Pollock & S Windle","owner_id":312676,"change_date":"2022-05-25"},{"owner":"A Pollock, S Windle & B Padgett","owner_id":303995,"change_date":"2021-12-31"},{"owner":"Maurice Manasseh","owner_id":239898,"change_date":"2021-05-08"},{"owner":"Pacific Partners","owner_id":279354,"change_date":"2020-08-25"}],"comment":"Has a mixed reappearance record; won twice last summer; not ruled out","spotlight":"8yo who has a mixed reappearance record and it remains to be seen if he's at the top of his game on this comeback outing; however, he won twice last summer (6f, good to firm/AW) and is not ruled out.","quotes":null,"stable_tour":null,"number":2,"draw":6,"headgear":"","headgear_first":"","lbs":135,"ofr":75,"rpr":86,"ts":73,"jockey":"Tom Kiely-Marshall(3)","jockey_id":100775,"last_run":"226","form":"14710-","silk_url":"https://www.rp-assets.com/svg/1/7/1/330171.svg","trainer_rtf":"40","stats":{"course":{"runs":"4","wins":"0"},"distance":{"runs":"24","wins":"5"},"going":{"runs":"13","wins":"1"},"jockey":{"last_14_runs":"8","last_14_wins":"0","last_14_wins_pct":"0%","last_14_profit":"-8.00","ovr_runs":"6","ovr_wins":"0","ovr_wins_pct":"0%","ovr_profit":"-6.00"},"trainer":{"last_14_runs":"24","last_14_wins":"0","last_14_wins_pct":"0%","last_14_profit":"-24.00","ovr_runs":"73","ovr_wins":"6","ovr_wins_pct":"8%","ovr_profit":"+8.00"}}},{"age":7,"horse_id":3153450,"name":"Kats Bob","dob":"2018-03-05","sex":"gelding","sex_code":"G","colour":"ch","region":"GB","breeder":"S Rudolf","dam":"Dreaming Of Stella","dam_region":"IRE","sire":"Bobbys Kitten","sire_region":"USA","grandsire":"Kittens Joy","damsire":"Giants Causeway","damsire_region":"USA","trainer":"Ruth Carr","trainer_id":20045,"trainer_location":"Stillington, N Yorks","trainer_14_days":{"runs":22,"wins":3,"percent":14},"owner":"Colin Dorman And Tommy Dorman","prev_trainers":[{"trainer":"Iain Jardine","trainer_id":21516,"change_date":"2025-02-14"}],"prev_owners":[{"owner":"Castle Construction (NE) Ltd","owner_id":217634,"change_date":"2020-07-30"}],"comment":"3-3 for current yard (all 6f on Tapeta) and has to be respected now back on turf","spotlight":"Made it 3-3 for this yard (all over 6f on Tapeta) when scoring at Southwell last month; last season's turf performances left something to be desired but he's a five-time winner on grass who has to be respected.","quotes":null,"stable_tour":[{"horse":"Kats Bob","horse_id":3153450,"quote":"He arrived here in February in good nick from Iain Jardine's stable looking for a change of scenery having been in the same yard since he was a yearling.
