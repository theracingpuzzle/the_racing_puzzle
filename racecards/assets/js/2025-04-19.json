He was very impressive in that last furlong and it was a beautifully timed run. It was good that Paul took a chance because the easy thing is to just let them run. Not many have tried to do the Portland-Ayr Gold Cup double- I think the last one to do it was Lochsong- and it was a tough ask. We decided to get a bit of cover to switch him off at Ayr and they probably didn't go hard enough. He was a wee bit unlucky in running but we weren't going to be winning it. It was a blip but it was his third run in three weeks. We may go to York for the big 6f race on October 12. His win in the Portland probably opens up a whole new ball game as there aren't many horses who have the turn of foot in class races like that. 02-10-24"}],"number":3,"draw":9,"headgear":"","headgear_first":"","lbs":131,"ofr":94,"rpr":114,"ts":100,"jockey":"Paul Mulrennan","jockey_id":79371,"last_run":"210","form":"22310-","silk_url":"https://www.rp-assets.com/svg/8/4/5/304548.svg","trainer_rtf":"21","stats":{"course":{"runs":"2","wins":"1"},"distance":{"runs":"8","wins":"2"},"going":{"runs":"5","wins":"2"},"jockey":{"last_14_runs":"20","last_14_wins":"0","last_14_wins_pct":"0%","last_14_profit":"-20.00","ovr_runs":"238","ovr_wins":"42","ovr_wins_pct":"18%","ovr_profit":"-21.78"},"trainer":{"last_14_runs":"19","last_14_wins":"1","last_14_wins_pct":"5%","last_14_profit":"-11.00","ovr_runs":"331","ovr_wins":"42","ovr_wins_pct":"13%","ovr_profit":"-53.61"}}},{"age":5,"horse_id":4175423,"name":"Tatterstall","dob":"2020-03-26","sex":"gelding","sex_code":"G","colour":"b","region":"IRE","breeder":"Maurice Burns","dam":"Nafa","dam_region":"IRE","sire":"Bungle Inthejungle","sire_region":"GB","grandsire":"Exceed And Excel","damsire":"Shamardal","damsire_region":"USA","trainer":"Michael Dods","trainer_id":5079,"trainer_location":"Piercebridge, Co Durham","trainer_14_days":{"runs":18,"wins":1,"percent":6},"owner":"D Stone & Mrs C Dods","prev_trainers":null,"prev_owners":[{"owner":"Mrs C Dods & D Stone","owner_id":252243,"change_date":"2022-04-19"}],"comment":"Two 5f wins last year, notably at Glorious Goodwood; needs a career best but it's possible","spotlight":"Speedy sort who won twice last year, notably at Glorious Goodwood (5f, good); absent since a good fourth off this mark at Southwell 233 days ago; career best required but that's not out of the question.","medical":[{"date":"2023-10-04","type":"Wind Surgery"}],"quotes":[{"date":"2023-06-03","horse":"Tatterstall","horse_id":4175423,"race":"Aston Martin 3YO \"Dash\" Handicap","race_id":839640,"course":"Epsom","course_id":17,"distance_f":5,"distance_y":1100,"quote":"We thought Tatterstall had a nice chance.
