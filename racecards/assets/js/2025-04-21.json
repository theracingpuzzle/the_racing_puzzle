I think a mile and a quarter is right for him. We went back for the stiff mile at Ascot as we felt on that track it was going to suit him and he got his just rewards. He can cope with those extremes out there today where a lot of other horses can't. He is in the Hong Kong Mile, but I think he deserves a nice break.

His second start when bolting up in Listed company at Newcastle had plenty of people talking about him and I must be honest I thought he'd win but not in the manner he did. We decided he had to take his place in the 2,000 Guineas but he never got a chance to show his true colours. He got wiped out at the start, which caused him to lose his action, and from there on things never went right. Unfortunately he came back sore, having knocked a joint. It has been hard work getting him back but he's there now and ready to go again. I looked at Royal Ascot but he had a slightly dirty scope before and you must be 100 per cent for that meeting. He heads to Newmarket for the July meeting, where we'll aim for the Listed Sir Henry Cecil Stakes over a mile and then we'll look to the Thoroughbred Stakes at Glorious Goodwood. He'll run at Newmarket as long as they get nice ground and hopefully we can get him back to where he was before the Guineas. He'll have to carry a penalty there for his Listed win but it's a lesser race and hopefully it'll help him get his confidence back. We're all very excited about getting him out again.

I thought his most recent run, when second in his first handicap was a lovely effort and hopefully we can get him out on the turf before the season ends, but he needs it on the soft side. He will continue through the winter on the all-weather as he is still progressing, and we can up him to 1m when the time is right. He is on a fair mark of 77 and I would be disappointed if he was not a nice bit better than that. 29-08-22"}],"number":5,"draw":6,"headgear":"","headgear_first":"","lbs":130,"ofr":50,"rpr":66,"ts":47,"jockey":"Andrew Mullen","jockey_id":81166,"last_run":"42","form":"-31884","silk_url":"https://www.rp-assets.com/svg/7/5/0/342057.svg","trainer_rtf":"56","stats":{"course":{"runs":"0","wins":"0"},"distance":{"runs":"10","wins":"1"},"going":{"runs":"1","wins":"0"},"jockey":{"last_14_runs":"24","last_14_wins":"1","last_14_wins_pct":"4%","last_14_profit":"-11.00","ovr_runs":"96","ovr_wins":"3","ovr_wins_pct":"3%","ovr_profit":"-68.90"},"trainer":{"last_14_runs":"9","last_14_wins":"0","last_14_wins_pct":"0%","last_14_profit":"-9.00","ovr_runs":"48","ovr_wins":"5","ovr_wins_pct":"10%","ovr_profit":"-9.00"}}},{"age":6,"horse_id":3588749,"name":"Variety Island","dob":"2019-01-16","sex":"gelding","sex_code":"G","colour":"b","region":"GB","breeder":"Hellwood Stud Farm","dam":"Love Island","dam_region":"GB","sire":"Spill The Beans","sire_region":"AUS","grandsire":"Snitzel","damsire":"Acclamation","damsire_region":"GB","trainer":"Simon Whitaker","trainer_id":38344,"trainer_location":"Scarcroft, W Yorks","trainer_14_days":{"runs":2,"wins":1,"percent":50},"owner":"Grange Park Racing Xvi And Partners","prev_trainers":null,"prev_owners":null,"comment":"Capable at this level but may come on for this first run in 130 days","spotlight":"Infrequent winner but capable at this level and has run well at this track in the past (7f);
