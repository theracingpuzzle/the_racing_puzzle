He was a little bit slowly away, he stood in the stalls for a while and I was a bit worried for a second or two, but Jim [Crowley, jockey] is very experienced and got him off the rail and round. I actually expected him to be under pressure a little bit earlier than he was.

He pulled hard on his hurdle debut at Kelso but he jumped really well and we were delighted with his performance. Two miles will be a bit sharp for him but we might stay there to get him to settle. We won't be in a great hurry, he might have another run before Christmas and we'll see where we are in the new year. His bumper form was very good and he is exciting. 15-11-23"}],"number":4,"draw":0,"headgear":"p","headgear_first":"","lbs":159,"ofr":86,"rpr":95,"ts":41,"jockey":"Ryan Mania","jockey_id":86359,"last_run":"31","form":"5-9PP3","trainer_rtf":"40","stats":{"course":{"runs":"2","wins":"1"},"distance":{"runs":"2","wins":"0"},"going":{"runs":"0","wins":"0"},"jockey":{"last_14_runs":"10","last_14_wins":"2","last_14_wins_pct":"20%","last_14_profit":"+16.50","ovr_runs":"109","ovr_wins":"11","ovr_wins_pct":"10%","ovr_profit":"+56.60"},"trainer":{"last_14_runs":"10","last_14_wins":"0","last_14_wins_pct":"0%","last_14_profit":"-10.00","ovr_runs":"85","ovr_wins":"9","ovr_wins_pct":"11%","ovr_profit":"-9.12"}}},{"age":8,"horse_id":2394550,"name":"Palm Beach","dob":"2017-03-07","sex":"gelding","sex_code":"G","colour":"b","region":"IRE","breeder":"Lynch-Bages & Rhinestone Bloodstock","dam":"Alta Anna","dam_region":"FR","sire":"Galileo","sire_region":"IRE","grandsire":"Sadlers Wells","damsire":"Anabaa","damsire_region":"USA","trainer":"John Dixon","trainer_id":651,"trainer_location":"Thursby, Cumbria","trainer_14_days":{"runs":1,"wins":0,"percent":0},"owner":"Mrs S F Dixon","prev_trainers":[{"trainer":"Joseph Patrick O'Brien","trainer_id":32145,"change_date":"2022-03-21"},{"trainer":"A P O'Brien","trainer_id":7978,"change_date":"2020-11-26"}],"prev_owners":[{"owner":"John P McManus","owner_id":20887,"change_date":"2022-03-21"},{"owner":"Mrs John Magnier & Michael Tabor & Derrick Smith","owner_id":143821,"change_date":"2020-11-26"},{"owner":"Derrick Smith","owner_id":144087,"change_date":"2020-04-22"},{"owner":"Mrs John Magnier & Michael Tabor & Derrick Smith","owner_id":143821,"change_date":"2020-03-05"},{"owner":"Derrick Smith & Mrs John Magnier & Michael Tabor","owner_id":145061,"change_date":"2019-08-14"}],"comment":"43lb lower than last winning mark; mixed form over various trips this term; bit to prove","spotlight":"Hasn't won for more than three years but is now rated 43lb lower; mixed form over a variety of distances this season; plenty to prove at present.","medical":[{"date":"2024-03-08","type":"Wind Surgery"},{"date":"2023-09-26","type":"Wind Surgery"}],"quotes":[{"date":"2022-03-27","horse":"Palm Beach","horse_id":2394550,"race":"Scottish Racing Academy Novices' Hurdle (GBB Race)","race_id":805309,"course":"Carlisle","course_id":8,"distance_f":19.5,"distance_y":4241,"quote":"Palm Beach felt like he was going half-speed the whole way round and he did that well.
