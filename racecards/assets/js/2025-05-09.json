That was over 6f again but having witnessed that effort you'd be stunned if he didn't get further as he looked to be crying out for a longer trip. It was an eyecatching run and hopefully his turn is very close. He's a smashing colt who was a Goffs UK purchase and we've been kind of targeting him at the sales race at York next week. He's also in the 6½f sales race at Doncaster's St Leger meeting next month. In time I see him doing well over a mile. He was bought very cheaply as he was a very big horse. Basically, he looked like a giant but he isn't at all and I think his owners have bought very well.
